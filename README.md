## ðŸŒŸOverview

The Face Recognition Project is a web-based application that utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to detect and recognize faces in images and video streams. This project aims to provide a robust solution for various applications, including security systems, user authentication, and interactive user experiences.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Detection**: Detect faces in real-time using webcam input.
- **Face Recognition**: Identify and recognize faces from a database of known individuals.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI for easy interaction and navigation.
- **Multiple Recognition Models**: Support for various machine learning models to enhance accuracy.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images for face recognition.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across modern web browsers.

## ðŸ“–Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for the application.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web application.
- **TensorFlow.js**: A library for machine learning in JavaScript, used for face detection and recognition.
- **OpenCV.js**: A JavaScript binding for OpenCV, used for image processing tasks.
- **Node.js**: Backend server for handling requests (if applicable).
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and layout.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webermayank/Face_Recognise_JS.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Face_Recognise_JS
   ```

3. **Install the packages
   ```bash
     npm install
   ```
4. ** Run the dev server at `http://localhost:3000`
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage

1. **Upload an Image**: Click on the upload button to select an image from your device.
2. **Use Webcam**: Click on the "Start Webcam" button to begin real-time face detection.
3. **View Results**: Detected faces will be highlighted, and recognized individuals will be displayed with their names.

## ðŸ“šHow It Works

The application uses a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques:

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascades or DNN models to locate faces in images.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts facial features using pre-trained models.
- **Face Recognition**: Compares extracted features against a database of known faces to identify individuals.
